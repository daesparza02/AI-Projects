# AI & Machine Learning Mini-Projects 

A collection of practical projects focused on implementing and exploring various Artificial Intelligence paradigms.

## Implemented Algorithms

* **Reinforcement Learning (RL):** Training autonomous agents for dynamic decision-making using reward systems.
* **Genetic Algorithms:** Solving optimization and search problems using evolution-inspired heuristics (selection, crossover, and mutation).
* **Recommender Systems:** Implementing prediction and filtering models to suggest personalized items based on user preferences and interactions.
